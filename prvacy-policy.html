        <li><strong>IP Verification:</strong> If enabled by the server admin, we may use IP-based verification to enhance security. IP data is securely processed and stored only for verification purposes.</li>

    <p>We do not share collected data with third parties, except as necessary to comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
